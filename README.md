<h1>Agent-based Building Stock Modelling

From 2021, Germany levies a national CO2 price in the transport and buildings sectors with the
purpose of promoting the switch to climate-friendly technologies and renewable energies.
Buildings are responsible for a large share of the energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. The project aims to construct a bottom-up building stock model to assess the impact
of CO2 taxation of operating energy on the building stock over time. In agent-based building stock
modeling, the stock development in terms of new construction, envelope retrofit, and replacement
of the heating system is determined by individual decisions at the building scale. Therefore, this
model can better address the question of policy-makers, because the impact of policy measures
such as a CO2 tax or subsidies on agent’s decisions are modeled explicitly.

##Task
In this project, you will create an agent-based building stock modeling.
>Study the model developed by Naegeli et al., 2020, by reading the ODD (Overview,
design concepts, and details) protocol
>Create the system using Python, Java or R.
>Run and test the model using a building example

##Requirements
>Good language skills in German or English
>Independent and thorough operation
>Programming experience in Python or Java
>Interest in building energy efficiency and sustainability
